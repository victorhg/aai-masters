Applied Artificial Intelligence Masters program at USD

Why pursue a master's degree? I want to have this intellectual framework to prepare me for the next cycle of growth in AI technologies - and with the advancement of LLM platforms, and their apparent discontent and low financial results, the next few years will be interesting, and I want to be more technically prepared for that.

I chose the University of San Diego for a few reasons:

- Important focus on integration with industry
- Teachers present in the course and proximity to the innovation ecosystem
- Pricing and apparent availability of international payment options
