# What to do
As I researched for this task, I came across an interesting fact that statistical errors are common in scientific literature and that about 50% of the published articles have at least one error (Curran-Everett D., 2004). There are multiple factors that contribute to this statistics, and one of the most relevant is failing the assumption of normality.

Normality and other assumptions should be taken seriously, for when these assumptions do not hold, it is impossible to draw accurate and reliable conclusions about reality(Baker, S. G., 2009).

# Answer

The article "Statistical errors in medical research: A review of the literature" (Baker, S. G., 2009) discusses common statistical errors encountered in medical research, particularly focusing on Type I and Type II errors. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding these errors when interpreting the results of statistical tests, especially in clinical trials and observational studies.

## Appropriate Statistic(s) Measured
Several statistical tests are mentioned on the article, including t-tests and chi-squared tests, which are commonly used to compare treatment groups or assess relationships between variables.

- Sample Population: The sample population consists of individuals selected from a larger population (e.g., patients receiving different treatments).
- Larger Population: The larger population refers to all individuals who could potentially receive treatment or be affected by the research question being studied.

## Statistical Errors Discussed
- Type I Error: This error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, leading to a false positive result. For example, if a study sets α at 0.05, there is a 5% chance of concluding that a difference exists when it actually does not.
- Type II Error: This error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected, leading to a false negative result. The power of a test (1 - β) reflects the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
- Standard Error:  A smaller standard error indicates that sample estimates are closer to the true population parameter, while a larger standard error suggests greater variability and uncertainty in estimates.

Inferential statistics are essential for linking treatment groups to broader population conclusions in research studies. Understanding statistical errors such as Type I and Type II errors is critical for interpreting results accurately and making informed decisions based on sample data. By using appropriate statistical tests like t-tests or chi-squared tests while considering these errors, researchers can contribute to evidence-based practices in their respective fields.
